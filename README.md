# Pizza Shop Order Menu

#### This website will allow users to choose a size of pizza and toppings, then place an order and see the final cost.

#### By **Steve Burton**

## Description
These are the steps I'll take to write my code:

It can select a pizza size and output a base price

It can add a topping and output the base price plus the topping price.

It can add up the number of toppings selected and return a total price.

When a user submits a number it will clear the form so they can submit another number

Add images and CSS styling.
